# Tiny School Hub :school:

Enhance teacher-parent communication effortlessly with this free and open-source education platform. Share photos, manage attendance, exchange messages, and stay updated on school announcements. Securely designed to protect student privacy and ensure authorized access. :lock:

## Context of this project

This project **is**, and **will remain** completely open-source as the idea is to provide an alternative to paid/closed-source
app that provides similar service. The idea is to maybe one day provide a modern solution that would benefit to public
preschool teachers/parents.

### Key Features :star:

For now, I'm working on : 

1. **User Registration and Login**: Allow teachers and parents to register and log in using their credentials. :busts_in_silhouette:
2. **Profile Creation**: Users can create profiles with information such as their name, photo, role (teacher or parent), and their child's class (for parents). :busts_in_silhouette:
3. **Photo Upload**: Teachers can send photos to parents, associating them with a specific class or event (school outing, in-class activity, etc.). :camera:
4. **Absence Notifications**: Teachers can notify parents of student absences, and parents can also inform teachers about their child's planned absences. :bell:
5. **Messaging**: Teachers and parents can exchange private messages to discuss specific student-related issues. :speech_balloon:
6. **Announcements and Events**: Teachers can post announcements and upcoming events, such as parent-teacher meetings, school outings, or school parties. :mega:
7. **Secure Space**: Ensure that the application is secure, allowing only authorized parents and teachers to access student information and photos. :shield:
